## OVERVIEW

- Name: BCG16
- Data bus: 8 bits
- Clock speed: 10 MHz
- Address bus: 16/20 bits

The BCG8 CPU is a 8-bit processor designed to reflect the technology and performance characteristics of the early DOS era (versions 3.x, 4.x, and potentially 5.x). It aims to compete with the Intel 8088/8086 in terms of raw performance.

based of the **IBM Personal System/2 Model 30286**

#### Note

## Date and Time

## CPU PINS

- IRQ: interrupt request

## INTERRUPTS

Interrupts can be triggered by software or hardware specified by the interrupt location port.

### SOFTWARE INTERRUPTS

A software interrupt can be generated using the [BRK](./instructions%20BCG8.md#special-instructions) Instruction and will make a long jump to 0x010000 in bank 0xF, before jumping the PC, MB and the F(flags register) will be push onto the stack and the [PUSHR](./instructions%20BCG8.md#special-instructions) Instruction will also be called.

## CACHES

## PORTS

The Ports can be communicate to and from using the [OUTB and INB](./instructions%20BCG8.md#io-instructions) instructions

Ports are memory-mapped IO.

### PS/2 PORTS

The PS/2 Mouse is at `0x00`

The PS/2 Keyboard is at `0x01`

### Screen (more in [Screen](#screen))

The VGA Screen port is at `0x02`

### Floppy Disk Ports

The Floppy Disk Ports are at `0x03 to 0x04`

### HDD

The 20MB HDD disk is at `0x05`

## Partial Printer Port

The Partial Printer Port is at `0x06`

### Expaction cards

There are 4 expaction cards at `0xFC-0xFF` using the Industry Standard Architecture(ISA)

## Screen

The screen is a 320Ã—240 VGA screen with a 8 bpp and 1 bit for Alpha

### Writing to the screen

to write to the screen you can use the [INT 0x10 interrupt routine](./interrupts.md#int-0x10-services) or write to the video memory at `0xDA800 - 0xFFFFF`

### Video Layout

- FFFF_FFFF
- Bitmap mode if the upper halv of the flags are 0
  - CCCCCCCC
- Char mode
  - CCCCCCCC_DDDDDDDD_AAAAAAAA
- Sprite mode
  - SSSSSSSS_AAAAAAAA

- S = Sprite index
- C = color index
- F = Flags

#### Flags

NOTE: if all the bit are 0 then it will be a pixel in bitmap mode, the jumpper can also be set and the bitmap mode will allways be active.

- bit 0:   is WIP?
- bit 1:   is Background Layer?
- bit 2:   is alpha?
- bit 3:   is WIP?
- bit 4:   is char?
- bit 5:   is Sprite?
- bit 6:   is WIP?
- bit 7:   is WIP?
  - if this bit is set, the char data will contain the ASCII char to be displayed and colored using the COLOR info

## Calling convention

The calling convention for the BCG architecture is as follows:

### Caller

1. Push Argments
   1. Push all the arguments from left to rigth onto the stack
2. Call the function using [CALL](./instructions%20BCG8.md#special-instructions)
3. Retrieve Return Value
   1. The return value will be in either the AL or HL register:
      1. Use the [HL](#registers) register if it's a pointer/address.
      2. Use the [AL](#registers) register if it's an immediate value.

### Callee

This is the sequence within the called function:

1. Save the Base Pointer
   1. Push the old [BP](#registers) onto the stack
2. Move the Base Pointer to the Stack Pointer
   1. Move the [BP](#registers) to [SP](#registers) `mov BP, SP`
3. Save All Registers
   1. Push all registers using the [PUSHR](./instructions%20BCG8.md#special-instructions) instruction.
   2. To access arguments, pop them off the stack or reference them using an offset.
4. Return Value
   1. Move the return value to the appropriate register:
      1. HL register if it's a pointer.
      2. AL register if it's an immediate value.
5. Restore Registers
   1. Pop all registers using the [POPR](./instructions%20BCG8.md#special-instructions) instruction.
6. Return from Function
    1. Return from the function with an offset depending on the size of the stack frame using the [RET](./instructions%20BCG8.md#general-instructions) instruction.

## MEMORY

The memory works by setting a segment and an offset like this

``` ACL
mov DS, 0x0080  ; moving 0x0080 into DS(data segment)
mov BX, 0x1000  ; moving 0x1000 into the BX register
mov AX, [DS:BX] ; here we are using the BX register for the offset
                ; so the real address is DS:BX or 0x00801000 
```

note: `all cells is in bytes`
