## OVERVIEW

- Name: BCG1684
- Data bus: 16/32 bits
- Clock speed: 10 MHz
- Address bus: 20 bits to a max of 32 bits

The BCG-1684 CPU is a 16/32-bit processor designed to reflect the technology and performance characteristics of the DOS era (versions 3.x, 4.x, and potentially 5.x). It aims to compete with the Intel 80286 in terms of raw performance.

based of the **IBM Personal System/2 Model 25**

#### Note

## Date and Time

## CPU PINS

- IRQ: interrupt request

## INTERRUPTS

Interrupts can be triggered by software or hardware specified by the interrupt location port.

### SOFTWARE INTERRUPTS

A software interrupt can be generated using the [BRK](./instructions%20BCG16.md#special-instructions) Instruction and will make a long jump to 0x010000 in bank 0xF, before jumping the PC, MB and the F(flags register) will be push onto the stack and the [PUSHR](./instructions%20BCG16.md#special-instructions) Instruction will also be called.

## CACHES

## Screen

The screen is a 320Ã—240 VGA screen with a 8 bpp and 1 bit for Alpha

### Writing to the screen

to write to the screen you can use the [INT 0x10 interrupt routine](../interrupts.md#int-0x10-services) or write to the video memory at `0x0098100 - 0x00E3100`

## Floating values

the BCG-16 does floating point values using an externel chip the BCG16FL-8F where the [float registers](#registers) so it will take longer to get/set the [floating point registers](#registers)

[datasheet](./SPECS_BCG16F-8F-FloatPointHelper%20CPU.md)

## Calling convention

The calling convention for the BCG architecture is as follows:

### Caller

1. Push Argments
   1. Push all the arguments from left to rigth onto the stack
2. Call the function using [CALL](./instructions%20BCG16.md#special-instructions)
3. Retrieve Return Value
   1. The return value will be in either the A or HL register:
      1. Use the [HL](#registers) register if it's a pointer/address.
      2. Use the [A](#registers) register if it's an immediate value.

### Callee

This is the sequence within the called function:

1. Save the Base Pointer
   1. Push the old [BP](#registers) onto the stack
2. Move the Base Pointer to the Stack Pointer
   1. Move the [BP](#registers) to [SP](#registers) `mov BP, SP`
3. Save All Registers
   1. Push all registers using the [PUSHR](./instructions%20BCG16.md#special-instructions) instruction.
   2. To access arguments, pop them off the stack or reference them using an offset.
4. Return Value
   1. Move the return value to the appropriate register:
      1. HL register if it's a pointer.
      2. AX register if it's an immediate value.
5. Restore Registers
   1. Pop all registers using the [POPR](./instructions%20BCG16.md#special-instructions) instruction.
6. Return from Function
    1. Return from the function with an offset depending on the size of the stack frame using the [RET](./instructions%20BCG16.md#general-instructions) instruction.

## MEMORY

The memory works by setting a segment and an offset like this

``` ACL
mov DS, 0x0080  ; moving 0x0080 into DS(data segment)
mov B,  0x1000  ; moving 0x1000 into the B register
mov A,  [DS:B]  ; here we are using the B register for the offset
                ; so the real address is DS:B or 0x00801000 
```

You can also do this in the `extended Addresing` mode

note: `all cells is in bytes`

### MEMORY LAYOUT

- Address bus: 20 bits to a max of 32 bits

|`0x0008_0000`|`0x0008_0000`| RAM Banked                    | this is the data/prgram is at but banked
|`0x0010_0000`|`0x00F0_0000`| RAM                           | this is the data/prgram is at

the end is `0x0FFF_FFFF`/`0x1000_0000`
